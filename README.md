# DinoJoust
## Implementation ##

The insipiration for this program came to create a game similar to the arcade classic, *Joust*, where the player is an ostrich-riding knight jousting other ostrich-riding knights. However, I decided to add a party-style battle royale twist, with support for up to four players to play at once, as dinosaurs in a cave with lava. Each dinosaur has three lives, and 

I was able to use similar methods to those in the Mario and Pong games, in the platformer layout of Mario, and the collision physics of pong to read collisions between the dinosaurs. By using a class for every player and the maps, the collisions between each object were mapped.
